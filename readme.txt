Project by ExPo:
Solo Project.

Tried to ake an extension with spotify integration and rive to load animations, but i couldn't load rive. this sucks.

OKAY WEBSITE THAT GIVES RANDOM MUSIC -> FIRST SPOTIFY, MAYBE YOUTUBE?
ability to walk around, large zoom....
or wait.
what if its like place, where you can zoom out... like... place embeds, or rather make like a grid, where you click, and you can set music, and you can go to a random pixel.

I WANTED TO USE SPOTIFY API but they don't allow me use their oauth flow without whitelist or waiting a long time, so instead, ill just use discord as an authentication method.
